PhonePe-Pulse-Data-Visualization

##  Technology Stack Used:
1. Python
2. MySQL
3. Streamlit
4. Github Cloning
5. Geo Visualisation
6. Dynamic Updation

## Method:

1. Data Extraction: Using scripting approaches, the data is extracted from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and cloned for further processing.

2. Data Transformation: To make the extracted data clean and ready for analysis, it is formatted into an appropriate structure. As required, preprocessing operations can be carried out.

3. Database Integration: To provide effective storage and retrieval capabilities, the converted data is inserted into a MySQL database.

4. Live Geo Visualisation Dashboard: To develop an engaging and interactive dashboard, Python's Streamlit and Plotly libraries are used. Users of this dashboard can effectively examine the insights because the data is presented in real-time.

5. Dashboard and Database Integration: The necessary information is retrieved from the MySQL database and merged into the dashboard without any issues.
